# Crossroad_Automation


Vehicle detection process on road are used for vehicle tracking, counts, average speed of
each individual vehicle, traffic analysis and vehicle categorizing objectives and may be
implemented under different environments changes. Vehicle detection is the critical step for
highway monitoring.
There are unscientific methods of directing or managing vehicles at crossroads. Vehicles are
directed manually by traffic police. Vehicles have to wait for a long time in queue. It often
results in unfair human decisions while directing vehicles at crossroads.
The system will help make traffic lights decisions by estimating the density of vehicles on
road with the help of image processing.
The result of this project is that we can process images obtained from various types of road
segments connecting an intersection. Vehicle densities can be extracted through these
processed images. The vehicle densities can be used to determine priorities of road segments
with the criteria that the road segment with the highest vehicle density will have the highest
priority. Then the vehicles with the highest priority will be passed.
